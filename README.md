Vulkan is a low-level cross platform API that allows developers to access the GPU microarchitecture more directly
compared to other rendering subsystems such as OpenGL or DirectX. This project expands the retro game Pong with more
modern graphics using Vulkan.

The key objectives of this project are
- Low Level Programming
- Microarchitectural Optimizations
- HPC using Physics simulation
- Graphics Programming
- Cross Platform Development

Roadmap
- 1.0: Environment Setup (NVIDIA Ampere, Driver Version: 550)
- 1.1: Hardware Checks
- 1.2: Window Creation and Intialization 
- 1.3: Swapchain and Framebuffer setup
- 1.4: Compute Shaders (Linear Algebra)
- 1.5: Pipeline, Command Buffer
- 1.6: Validation Layers
- 1.7: Microarchitectural Optimizations for AMD64 + Ampere
- 1.8: Ray Tracing

  Long Term Goals
  - Ray Tracing
  - Microarchitectural Optimizations for AMD GPU's (Radeon Architecture)
  - Microarchitectural Optimizations for Intel x86_64 ISA
  - Use of AMD ROCM, Compute Units or NVIDIA CUDA + Tensor Cores
  - SIMD Floating Point Math
  - OpenMP
  - Inlined AMD64 Assembly
